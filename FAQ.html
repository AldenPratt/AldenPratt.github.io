<h2>What projects are you guys working on?</h2>
<p>Our current project, Vergelands, is a post-apocalyptic survival thriller.  Set in the not-so-distance
future, Vergelands will test your survival instincts, your social aptitude, your greed, and much more.</p>

<h2>When is the next game coming out?</h2>
  <p>Ahh scheduling... It can be so hard these days.  I wouldn't hold my breath if I were you.
  We can't say for sure, but our initial beta release of Vergelands is planned for December 2023.
  More to follow later.</p>

<h2>What tools do you guys use?</h2>
<p>Our office has always been a big fan of using Unity for our game development.  We use Unity in conjunction
with Visual Studio to create the most high-quality games imaginable.  For graphics, 3D modelling and animation,
we are big fans for Blender.  We use Github for our code repositories.</p>

<h2>How can I help?</h2>
<p>Spread the word! We are a small game development company with not much publicity.  The best that you can
is share our work with all of your gaming friends.</p>
